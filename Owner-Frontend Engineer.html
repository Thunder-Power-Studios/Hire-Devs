<h3>üö®Problem</h3>
<p>Restaurant owners are the biggest group of business owners in the United States. Most of them started by working in restaurants and saved up for years to pursue their own American dream. They are great people: working 24/7 to support their families and provide amazing experiences. But they're struggling to survive. Corporations are crushing them using scale and advanced technology. Unfair tech companies are exploiting them by stealing their customers and forcing them to pay fees. This is their darkest time. If they don't find a way to survive, they will all go out of business.
